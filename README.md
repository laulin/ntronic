## ðŸ”§ About This Project

Welcome to this open-source educational electronics game designed to help children (and curious adults!) **discover the basics of electricity and electronics through hands-on experimentation**.

The game is made of **modular blocks** that can be easily assembled to create functioning electric circuits â€” from simple switches to more complex logic and sensor-based modules.

## ðŸ§² Magnetic Connections

Each module connects to others using **two magnets** and a **metal contact tab**, making assembly intuitive, secure, and fun. There's no need for wires or tools â€” just snap and play!

## âš¡ Safe and Kid-Friendly

The system runs on **5V**, ensuring **no electrical hazard**. Itâ€™s completely safe for supervised educational use and perfect for STEM discovery at home or in the classroom.

## ðŸ§© Modular System

All blocks follow a **60x60mm base size**, but larger modules can be built using multiples of that base unit. For example, the `power_supply` module is a **1x2 block (60x120mm)** to accommodate additional electronics.

## ðŸ”Œ USB-C Power with Built-in Safety

Power is supplied through a dedicated `power_supply` module using **USB-C**. This module also acts as a **circuit breaker**, protecting the system from short circuits and misuse â€” so you can explore without worry.
